###  Wataburger

Sweet burgers and shit, love this place #squadgoals.

Another review if two people review the same restaurant.


### Lick

So many good licks to be had here.
I've done a lot of licking - trust me these are good licks.
Sometimes very crowded so you sometimes have to take a licking and NOT keep on ticking!

## Supper

This place has laughably tiny food for huge dollars. Bar tenders were super cool. Delicious but pricey $$$.
