### Pappadeaux

  Pappadeaux is a great seafood restaurant with a New Orleans flare.

  Awesome environment and great service, very family friendly!

### Nama Ramen

  Nama Ramen was one of my favorite spots to go to for ramen and sushi. Since they were open late and right down the street from where I worked, they were a perfect late night sit down restaurant to hang out in. They have cool paintings of popular anime characters on the wall and are BYOB
